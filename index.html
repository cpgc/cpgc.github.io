<h3>
<a id="capitalism-bad" class="anchor" href="#capitalism-bad" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hold on a minute. What's so bad about capitalism?</h3>

<p>In short: capitalism is shit. If you're a student from Glendowie, capitalism will make your life shit. Capitalism has caused house-prices in Auckland to balloon. Based on past house price data, by 2025, a one-bedroom flat will cost an average of $2 million. For the rest of your life, you'll be in the process of continually attempting to find a bunch of shitty, unfulfilling jobs, where for six hours each day you slog through a meaningless tedium to enrich your boss. In many cases, you will hate his guts. Many times, capitalism will fuck you over, randomly introducing huge financial crises in which trillions of dollars are wiped from the world forever. In 2016, January, the stock market lost so much value that we officially went back three years. You might be unemployed for a long period of time, where you will be as unfulfilled as when you were working. You might have to declare bankruptcy and sell all of your belongings. You won't want to live, but you won't want to die either.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-is-socialism-better" class="anchor" href="#why-is-socialism-better" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Well, fuck. Why is socialism better, then?</h3>

<p>In socialism, housing is free. In capitalism, if you want to find a job, you have to spend two months CC'ing your CV to a hundred different people and turn up to a bunch of interviews where you'll end up competing with twenty other people over your monthly paycheck. Socialist countries have zero unemployment. If you want to find a job in a socialist country, you basically just go to the job bureau, they look up your credentials, and you get a job.</p>

<p>How do you get to your workplace? Public transportation, which, in socialism, is completely free and isn't shit like our public transportation. When you get there, you won't be working for the enrichment of your boss. You'll be working for your comrades, your friends. Unlike in capitalism, you will have a say in what happens in the company through a democratic vote. Will you suddenly lose your job? In socialism, there <i>is</i></a> no stock market, and there are no economic crashes in which people have to be constantly laid off. Socialist countries <i>plan</i> their economies to make sure nothing unexpected happens and to ensure that you have complete security. And that growth doesn't just go to the billionaires - socialism is all about equality. Everyone benefits. </p>

<a id="whats-the-other-one-percent" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-other-one-percent" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the other 1%?</h3>

<p>The other 1% is the capitalist class. Under capitalism, workers depend on capitalists to give them jobs. Likewise, capitalists depend on workers to perform labour for them. Workers must perform labour for capitalists, because otherwise they would have no money. If they had no money, they wouldn't be able to buy clothes, food, or shelter. </p>

<h3>
<a id="where-does-socialism-come-in" class="anchor" href="#where-does-socialism-come-in" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So where does socialism come into this?</h3>

<p>Imagine you are a baker (part of the working-class) in a large bread factory. As soon as you finish making a loaf of bread, it is no longer <i>your</i> loaf of bread. That loaf of bread is now owned by the capitalist who is employing you, even though he will have done nothing when it comes to making the loaf of bread. A concept in socialism is "exploitation". You might spend your time making a loaf of bread that is worth $5, and the capitalist will give you $1.50. Of course - if he gave you $5 for making the bread, he wouldn't make any profit! Yet you produced a loaf of bread worth $5, and you have been short-changed by $3.50. This is what exploitation is. </p>

<h3>
<a id="isnt-that-theft" class="anchor" href="#isnt-that-theft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Isn't that theft?</h3>

<p>The capitalist will say no: they will claim that they deserved all the money because they were "entrepreneurs", and they "allowed" you to use their bread-making equipment. Of course, capitalists know that people become very angry when they know that they are being exploited. Socialists disagree: they have a phrase <b>"all profits are unpaid wages"</b>. Capitalists want to extract higher profits, but workers want to have higher wages. Because of this, the interests of the 99% and the 1% are opposite to one another. Some countries, like Sweden and New Zealand, are based around strong working-class movements. This means that workers will be exploited less. In other countries, capitalists don't actively try to hide the fact that they are exploitating workers: sweatshops in India and Haiti, for example. If there was no exploitation happening, there would be no profit for the capitalists. </p>

<p>Remember how the capitalist said that they deserve to be able to take your bread because they own the bread-making equipment? Socialists say: "then why not take the bread-making equipment?" Indeed, in many countries and in many companies, workers <i>did</i> rise up against the capitalists and take the bread-making equipment. They took ownership of the <b>means of production</b>.</p>
