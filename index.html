<h3>
<a id="who-you-guys" class="anchor" href="#who-you-guys" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are you guys?</h3>

<p>We are a fun, inclusive radical far-left-wing revolutionary party with ambitions ranging from overthrowing Mr Dykes to overthrowing the New Zealand government.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-do-we-want class="anchor" href="#what-do-we-want" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do you guys want?</h3>

<p>In sequential order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher and fairer wages for working people</li>
  <li>Democracy in the workplace and free speech</li>
  <li>Revolutionary overthrow of the government</li>
  <li>Abolition of private property and wage slavery</li>
  <li>The seizing of all factories and industry for the working people</li>
  <li>Global revolutionary overthrow of all governments</li>
  <li>Unification of all the world's countries and communal ownership of all of the world's industry</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="capitalism-bad" class="anchor" href="#capitalism-bad" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hold on a minute. What's so bad about capitalism?</h3>

<p>In short: capitalism is shit. If you're a student from Glendowie, capitalism will make your life shit. Capitalism has caused house-prices in Auckland to balloon. Based on past house price data, by 2025, a one-bedroom flat will cost an average of $2 million. For the rest of your life, you'll be in the process of continually attempting to find a bunch of shitty, unfulfilling jobs, where for six hours each day you slog through a meaningless tedium to enrich your boss. In many cases, you will hate his guts. Many times, capitalism will fuck you over, randomly introducing huge financial crises in which trillions of dollars are wiped from the world forever. In 2016, January, the stock market lost so much value that we officially went back three years. You might be unemployed for a long period of time, where you will be as unfulfilled as when you were working. You might have to declare bankruptcy and sell all of your belongings. You won't want to live, but you won't want to die either.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-is-socialism-better" class="anchor" href="#why-is-socialism-better" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Well, fuck. Why is socialism better, then?</h3>

<p>In socialism, housing is free. In capitalism, if you want to find a job, you have to spend two months CC'ing your CV to a hundred different people and turn up to a bunch of interviews where you'll end up competing with twenty other people over your monthly paycheck. Socialist countries have zero unemployment. If you want to find a job in a socialist country, you basically just go to the job bureau, they look up your credentials, and you get a job.</p>

<p>How do you get to your workplace? Public transportation, which, in socialism, is completely free and isn't shit like our public transportation. When you get there, you won't be working for the enrichment of your boss. You'll be working for your comrades, your friends. Unlike in capitalism, you will have a say in what happens in the company through a democratic vote. Will you suddenly lose your job? In socialism, there <i>is</i></a> no stock market, and there are no economic crashes in which people have to be constantly laid off. Socialist countries <i>plan</i> their economies to make sure nothing unexpected happens and to ensure that you have complete security. And that growth doesn't just go to the billionaires - socialism is all about equality. Everyone benefits. </p>
