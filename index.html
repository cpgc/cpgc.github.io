<p>Socialism is the movement for the liberation of the working class.</p>

It's all flat.' " style="width:304px">

<p>The working class is anyone who needs to work in order to live. This is 99% of all people.</p>

<h3>
<a id="whats-the-other-one-percent" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-other-one-percent" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the other 1%?</h3>

<p>The other 1% is the capitalist class. Under capitalism, workers depend on capitalists to give them jobs. Likewise, capitalists depend on workers to perform labour for them. Workers must perform labour for capitalists, because otherwise they would have no money. If they had no money, they wouldn't be able to buy clothes, food, or shelter. </p>

<a id="where-does-socialism-come-in" class="anchor" href="#where-does-socialism-come-in" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So where does socialism come into this?</h3>

<p>Imagine you are a baker (part of the working-class) in a large bread factory. As soon as you finish making a loaf of bread, it is no longer <i>your</i> loaf of bread. That loaf of bread is now owned by the capitalist who is employing you, even though he will have done nothing when it comes to making the loaf of bread. A concept in socialism is "exploitation". You might spend your time making a loaf of bread that is worth $5, and the capitalist will give you $1.50. Of course - if he gave you $5 for making the bread, he wouldn't make any profit! Yet you produced a loaf of bread worth $5, and you have been short-changed by $3.50. This is what exploitation is. </p>

<h3>
<a id="isnt-that-theft" class="anchor" href="#isnt-that-theft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Isn't that theft?</h3>

<p>The capitalist will say no: they will claim that they deserved all the money because they were "entrepreneurs", and they "allowed" you to use their bread-making equipment. Of course, capitalists know that people become very angry when they know that they are being exploited. Socialists disagree: they have a phrase <b>"all profits are unpaid wages"</b>. Capitalists want to extract higher profits, but workers want to have higher wages. Because of this, the interests of the 99% and the 1% are opposite to one another. Some countries, like Sweden and New Zealand, are based around strong working-class movements. This means that workers will be exploited less. In other countries, capitalists don't actively try to hide the fact that they are exploitating workers: sweatshops in India and Haiti, for example. If there was no exploitation happening, there would be no profit for the capitalists. </p>

<p>Remember how the capitalist said that they deserve to be able to take your bread because they own the bread-making equipment? Socialists say: "then why not take the bread-making equipment?" Indeed, in many countries and in many companies, workers <i>did</i> rise up against the capitalists and take the bread-making equipment. They took ownership of the <b>means of production</b>.</p>
