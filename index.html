<h3>
<a id="who-you-guys" class="anchor" href="#who-you-guys" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are you guys?</h3>

<p>We are a fun, inclusive, progressive, radical far-left-wing revolutionary party with ambitions ranging from overthrowing Mr Dykes to overthrowing the New Zealand government.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-do-socialists-believe class="anchor" href="#what-do-socialists-believe" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do we believe?</h3>

<p>In sequential order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Working people should have higher and fairer wages</li>
  <li>Quality housing, transportation, and education, should be free</li>
  <li>We believe in ending human rights abuses and imperialist wars</li>
  <li>We believe that capitalism is directly responsible for all war, pollution, poverty, homelessness, unemployment, discrimination, exploitation and crisis</li>
  <li>We believe that for the advancement of humanity, the economy must be rationally and scientifically planned</li>
  <li>We believe that fair system is a system which places people over profits</li>
  <li>We believe that in order to achieve socialism, capitalism itself must be overthrown</li>
</ul>

<a id="capitalism-bad" class="anchor" href="#capitalism-bad" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hold on a minute. I'm a student from Glendowie. What's so bad about capitalism?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Capitalism means your university education will cost at least $20,000.</li>
    <li>Capitalism means your first house will cost you $2,000,000.</li>
    <li>Capitalism means that you will be in debt to a bank for the rest of your adult life.</li>
    <li>Capitalism means that you will be essentially forced to do shit jobs for people that you don't like.</li>
    <li>Capitalism allows those people to exploit you and make themselves richer, even if you hate them.</li>
    <li>Capitalism will randomly fuck you over with in enormous financial crises in which you lose all of your savings and might lose your home.</li>
    <li>Capitalism is responsible for 34 million deaths every year because...</li>
    <li>Even though we have enough food to feed nine billion people adequately, 2 billion people are malnourished and 350 million people are wasting (physically deteriorating due to lack of food). On the flip side, there are 2 billion obese people. Capitalism, which distributes food according to your ability to pay for it, chooses wealthy American fatsos over starving African children, even when it clearly doesn't make any sense.</li>
    <li>Tens of millions of deaths result from obesity and cigarettes, neither of which would be a problem if a) the food industry was interested in keeping people healthy instead of generating profits for their shareholders and b) cigarette corporations didn't exist. Honestly, fuck them. </li>
    <li>Capitalism allows corporations to raise the prices of life-saving medicines to thousands of dollars per pill and put patents on malaria drugs. This is the main reason by malaria still kills millions of people every year, even though it costs less than a cent per pill to produce.</li>
     <li>Capitalism means politicians are bought by and funded by rich corporate interests.</li>
    <li>Capitalism is intrinsically tied into systems of oppression such as racism, the patriarchy, and heteronormativity.</li>
     <li>Capitalism is shit.</li>
  </ul>

<a id="why-is-socialism-better" class="anchor" href="#why-is-socialism-better" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Damn. Why is socialism better, then?</h3>

<p>In socialism, housing is free. In capitalism, if you want to find a job, you have to spend two months CC'ing your CV to a hundred different people and turn up to a bunch of interviews where you'll end up competing with twenty other people over your monthly paycheck. Socialist countries have zero unemployment. If you want to find a job in a socialist country, you basically just go to the job bureau, they look up your credentials, and you get a job.</p>

<p>How do you get to your workplace? Public transportation, which, in socialism, is completely free and isn't shit like our public transportation. When you get there, you won't be working for the enrichment of your boss. You'll be working for your comrades, your friends. Unlike in capitalism, you will have a say in what happens in the company through a democratic vote. Will you suddenly lose your job? In socialism, there <i>is</i></a> no stock market, and there are no economic crashes in which people have to be constantly laid off. Socialist countries <i>plan</i> their economies to make sure nothing unexpected happens and to ensure that people's lives improve. And that growth doesn't just go to the billionaires - socialism is all about equality. Everyone benefits. </p>

<a id="socialism-and-state" class="anchor" href="#socialism-and-state" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I have more questions, where do I go?</h3>

<p>Either ask the General Secretary in person, or ask your question on our Facebook group. In the meanwhile, check out our <a href="http://cpgc.github.io/questions">question section</a>.</p>

<a id="north-korea" class="anchor" href="#north-korea" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Isn't socialism like North Korea and stuff?</h3>

<p>It's possible to say a lot of things about North Korea, but consider that up until the 1990's, North Korea matched (and overtook) South Korea in terms of their economy and standards of living. They did this while spending 25% of their GDP on their military, and under some of the most comprehensive and well-enforced economic embargoes and sanctions that have ever been imposed in recent history. Imagine if Australia stopped trading with New Zealand. Now imagine if China stopped trading with New Zealand. Honestly, we'd be pretty screwed. The only trade North Korea ever did was with other socialist countries, and in 1991, they all stopped trading with North Korea over the course of a month. North Korea then got hit with a famine, had their electrical infrastructure destroyed by flooding, had their agriculture destroyed by droughts - and don't forget, this is a country which had its industry and cities literally bombed flat during the Korean War. Pyongyang in the 1960s: </p>

While this is what Pyongyang looks like today:

<p>But obviously, North Korea isn't the best example. The People's Republic of China underwent a revolution in 1949, planning its economy in the interest of people rather than profits. Below is a comparison between the economic growth of the capitalit world versus the economic growth of China. </p>
